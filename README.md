# DeXSS -- Java program for removing JavaScript from HTML

Dynamic web sites which allow users to enter text content
containing HTML are at risk for so-called *cross-site scripting* attacks
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Site_Scripting),
[Securitydocs](http://www.securitydocs.com/library/3472)) attacks.

A common approach taken to mitigate this risk is to allow
some HTML content, but block content that is potentially
harmful. One problem with a straightforward approach to blocking such
content is that HTML parsing in browsers differs from the ideal,
and nefarious individuals can take advantage of these differences
to obscure content.

DeXSS uses [TagSoup](http://tagsoup.info) an
open-source HTML parser that attempts to mimic how web browsers
work. TagSoup reads wild HTML and generates [SAX2](http://www.saxproject.org) events. DeXSS invokes
TagSoup and follows it with a pipeline of SAX2 filters to remove HTML
tags such as <code>script</code> and attribute values containing such
scripts.

## Status
DeXSS 1.2 is an Alpha release.  You should be aware of the following issues:

- This release implements a <em>blacklist</em> approach, which has advantages over a whitelist approach, but also has inherent risks.  There are still a number of known XSS attacks that DeXSS does not yet detect.
- DeXSS is agressive about removing style attributes that fail the CSS analyzer.  There are probably other CSS attacks that DeXSS does not protect against.
- Elements that TagSoup thinks should be in the <em>head</em> are discarded by the default settings; changing the BODY_ONLY flag to allow <em>head</em> content will reduce effectiveness greatly.  Consequently, DeXSS should not be used to parse entire user-provided HTML files, but only parts that are destined for inclusion.
- The output of DeXSS is intended for browsers, not for storage.  As a result, some constructs may be overly verbose.
- Configurability and test suites are lacking.
- DeXSS does not specially handle any HTML5 elements or attributes not present in HTML4; **see HTMLCleaner below**.

If you have an interest in working on these issues, please consider contributing to the project.

## DeXSS API
DeXSS includes the following classes for direct use:


- <a href="docs/api/org/dexss/Test.html">Test</a>, a command-line utility for testing XSS
removal.

- <a href="docs/api/org/dexss/DeXSS.html">DeXSS</a>, which implements a string-to-string
conversion of HTML, with XSS removal.

- <a href="docs/api/org/dexss/DeXSSParser.html">DeXSSParser</a>, which can be used directly as a SAX2 parser to
produce SAX2 events from an input stream.

- <a href="docs/api/org/dexss/DeXSSFilterPipeline.html">DeXSSFilterPipeline</a>, which can be used as a SAX2 filter if you have already used TagSoup to produce SAX2 events

## Todo
- CSS analyzer is still not applied to style elements, only style attributes.
- Should upgrade from TagSoup to HTMLCleaner to get HTML5
- Should offer both blacklist and whitelist configurations for pipeline.
- Should upgrade build and test system to modern standards.
